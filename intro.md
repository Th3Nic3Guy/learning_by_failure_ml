# Learning By Failure | Machine Learning

A repository of sample notebooks to learn concepts of Applied Machine Learning in a Project Oriented Approach.

The repository is a part of the `Learning By Failure` series, where we learn concepts by failing and understanding the reasons behind the failure.

We use a central theme project to first build a need to learn the concepts of Machine Learning and then apply them to solve the problem.
