# Learning By Failure | Machine Learning

A repository of sample notebooks to learn concepts of Applied Machine Learning in a Project Oriented Approach.

The repository is a part of the `Learning By Failure` series, where we learn concepts by failing and understanding the reasons behind the failure.

We use a central theme project to first build a need to learn the concepts of Machine Learning and then apply them to solve the problem.

> Please note: Stock Market is a complex domain and the project is only for educational purposes. The project is not intended to be used for real-world trading. The "Learning By Failure" concept is intended to target something so aspirational that we wish learn more to try and achieve our goals.
