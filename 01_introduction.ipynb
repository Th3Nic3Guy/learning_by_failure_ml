    "\n",
    "`Machine Learning` in essence is basically `Mathematics` on overdrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is `Machine Learning`? What is the basic level of ML?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x>10:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than 10\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this `Machine Learning`? \n",
    "\n",
    "> No, this is a rule based system. But re-imagine \n",
    "this example as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python  \n",
    "if x>y:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than 10\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where the value of `y` is adjusted but mathematical operations and \n",
    "feedback rather than you explicitly setting the value as 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this now `Machine Learning`?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, this is a basic example of `Machine Learning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First try to understand What is `Artificial Intelligence`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of `Artificial Intelligence`, the buzzword of the decade, as the ability to learn the art of decision making.\n",
    "Whether the decision is the action to switch on the bulb based on light intensity on the sensor or the descision to \n",
    "turn the car wheel in case of any object detected in front of the car or the ability to predict the next word in \n",
    "the sequence of sentence, or just taking the descision to determine which object is present in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Machine Learning` is the subset of this AI, `ML` is about building a mathematical set of equations which take \n",
    "some set of inputs and outputs a value which can be `inferred` by down stream systems as a descision.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is the `if..else...end` condition that saves our efforts to come up with rules that execute certain actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Read more on this, the correct name for this process is called [Markov decision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now having said that, its imperative to understand that `Machine Learning` the folling points:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Machine Learning` is not a magic wand that can solve all the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the problem statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"I want to predict the stock price of a company for the next 10 days with `100%` accuracy. Consider `all` the news, the financial reports, the market conditions, the global economy, the political conditions, the weather, the mood of the CEO, the mood of the employees, the mood of the investors, the mood of the market, the mood of the world, the mood of the universe, the mood of the aliens, the mood of the sun, the mood of the moon, the mood of the stars, the mood of the black hole, the mood of the dark matter, the mood of the dark energy, the mood of the dark force, the mood of the dark side... and so on.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very common problem statement that is thrown around in the world of `Machine Learning`(not all the moods, but some of them are included). \n",
    "People consider Machine Learning as the magic wand that can pull up all the data, do its hocus focus and give you the answer. No `Machine Learning` cannot do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Machine Learning` is purely mathematics. Anything and everything that you would solve via `Machine Learning` first needs to be translated to mathematics first and then back to business problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Consider the same problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"I want to predict the stock price of a company for the next 10 days with `a considerable/acceptable/High` accuracy. \n",
    "> Consider `relevant` the news, the financial reports. Provide me with the probability of the stock price going up or down.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a more realistic problem statement. What you need here is to translate the problem statement to a mathematical problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Translated Mathematical statement: \"Given the historical data of the stock price, the news, the financial reports, \n",
    "> predict the `estimated` stock price of the company for the next `10 days` with a probability of the stock price going up or down.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This translated statement means that the model would get historical data and vectorized financial statements and news data and then predict/estimate the stock price for the next 10 days. It should also provide a probability/confidence score of the stock price going up or down, values ranging `[-1, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning leverages the power of `Statistics` and generalizes the input data in various dimensions and equation to represent the input data in a mathematical form and then applies further transformations and operations to output a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This value is then \"inferred\" as a decision by the downstream systems. A value output of [-1, 1] would be *inferred* as a confidence score and the direction of the stock movement, or a value like -2.4 or +5.4 may be inferred as the delta in the current value of the stock. How you infer the value is up to you and the business problem.\n",

    "## Machine Learning: The process\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the modern free and open source libraries available, the process of `Machine Learning` has been simplified to a great extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically for a layman, the concept of building a model can be boiled down to the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = Model() # Any kind of model\n",
    "model.fit(training_data) # Fit the model with the training data\n",
    "model.predict(test_data) # Predict the output of the test data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic most simplified code for `Machine Learning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in reality, the process of `Machine Learning` is a bit more complex. The process can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Statement**: Define the problem statement. What are you trying to solve? What is the business problem? What is the mathematical problem?\n",
    "2. **Data Collection**: Collect the data. The data can be in any form, structured, unstructured, semi-structured. The data can be from various sources, databases, files, APIs, etc.\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data. The data collected may have missing values, outliers, etc. The data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed before feeding it to the model.\n",
    "4. **Feature Engineering**: The data collected may have a lot of features. Some features may be irrelevant, some may be redundant. The data needs to be analyzed and features need to be selected which are relevant to the problem statement.\n",
    "5. **Model Selection**: Select the model. There are various models available for various problems. The model needs to be selected based on the problem statement.\n",
    "6. **Model Training**: Train the model. The model needs to be trained with the training data. The model learns the patterns in the data and builds a mathematical model.\n",
    "    - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model. The model needs to be evaluated with the test data. The model is evaluated based on various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.\n",
    "    - **Model Tuning**: Tune the model. The model may not give the desired results in the first go. The model needs to be tuned with various hyperparameters to get the best results.\n",
    "    - **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model. The model needs to be deployed in the production environment. The model should be able to take the input data and give the output.\n",
    "    - **Model Monitoring**: Monitor the model. The model needs to be monitored in the production environment. The model should be able to handle the real-time data and give the output.\n",
    "    - **Model Maintenance**: Maintain the model. The model needs to be maintained in the production environment. The model should be able to adapt to the changing data and give the output.\n",
    "7. **Model Prediction**: Predict the output. The model is now ready to predict the output based on the input data.\n",
    "8. **Model Inference**: Infer the output. The output of the model is inferred based on the problem statement. The output can be in any form, a class label, a probability, a value, etc.\n",
    "9. **Downstream Systems**: The output of the model is used by the downstream systems to make the decisions. The downstream systems can be any system that takes the output of the model and makes the decisions.\n",
    "10. **Feedback Loop**: The output of the downstream systems is fed back to the model. The model learns from the feedback and improves the predictions. The feedback loop is essential for the model to learn and adapt to the changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the overall project structure of a `Machine Learning` project. The process may vary based on the problem statement and the data available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, many times, some steps of the process may need to be performed in reverse to actually understand how the previous step would even be designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the project oriented approach, I will try to illustrate each step in this notebook.\n"
